This is a RestFULL API built on the FastAPI that can be used to classify whether news is real or fake. It uses a Logistic Regression model trained on 76,353 examples of real and fake news.
This is code was used for my Msc Project on building an app for detecting fake news but is now deprecated due to Integrating the project with Streamlit Framework.
